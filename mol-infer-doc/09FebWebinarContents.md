## Today's Sum-up
+ Comments to our graph learning model
+ Limitations on existing comparison results
+ Explore what next to be done

## To be done
+ Summarize our graph learning model (including structures, param numbers, etc.). Prepare some explanatory figure for future discussions.
+ Adjust the used QM9 dataset, keep it same as what is fed to Mol-infer. Adjust the number of dataset within 20,000 molecules.
+ Give results on both train set and test set, test whether there is over-fitting.
+ Try more properties and more datasets.

## Future Direction
+ Explore graph learning's limitations, manully adding some features that GL can't tell is feasible or not?
+ Explore graph learning's representations, how to evaluation them and explain them?
